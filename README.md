# 🍪 Crumbl Cookies Sales System

## 🧠 Project Justification

This project represents one of my first significant experiences in software development using **Java with NetBeans**, applying core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Although it was created as an academic challenge, the system addresses a real-world need: optimizing cookie sales and management processes in a retail environment, inspired by the successful **Crumbl Cookies** franchise.

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a digital system that simulates a cookie store’s purchasing process, providing a simple yet functional console interface that manages inventory, products, and user orders, while reinforcing key OOP concepts.

## 🕵️ Field Study

The system is inspired by the business model of **Crumbl Cookies**, a brand known for its rotating weekly menu, gourmet cookies, and customizable order experience. While the physical store operates efficiently, it was evident that a digital tool could enhance operational management, reduce manual errors, and offer a more streamlined experience—especially for training, simulation, or expansion purposes.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 📋 **Cookie Catalog:** Displays available cookies with names and prices.
- 🛍️ **Purchase Simulation:** Users can select cookies and specify quantities.
- 💰 **Automatic Calculation:** The system calculates the total purchase amount.
- 🔁 **Order Editing:** Users can adjust their selection before confirming.
- ✅ **Order Confirmation:** A summary is shown with all chosen products and the final amount due.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

Although this was a team project, I was responsible for developing approximately **70% of the code**, including the core logic, class design, product management, and purchase simulation.  
My teammate **José** contributed the remaining **30%**, mainly by assisting in implementing additional functionalities and testing the system.
