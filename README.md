# Crumbl_Cookies_Sales_System
This project represents one of my first significant experiences in software development using **Java with NetBeans**, applying core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Although it was created as an academic challenge, the system addresses a real-world need: optimizing cookie sales and management processes in a retail environment.
